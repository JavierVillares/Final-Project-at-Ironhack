# Final-Project-at-Ironhack 2024

In this project I have been adressing my concern of whether Overpopulation is going to be a problem. After some reasearch and finding some good CSV o give me an overview of the world state and the trend in the last 40 years... This was my reaction looking at Birth rates:

And then I asked myself...

![But why](https://github.com/JavierVillares/Final-Project-at-Ironhack/blob/main/Emojis/200w.gif)



After some thinking I have to go on a quest for answers... And here is my story. 

I first started to look for reasons of commonalities with countries that have a low birthrate. I found that most of them were quite westernized. So i looked into GPD per capita, Average Age, Growth Rates, Death rates AND Education level.

It worked wonders afte making sure all countries were accounted for. Data was clean working perfecly and with Nulls values. I started to do machine learning and finding the best options that had the highest R^2 score and lowest MSE scores. Found the one (linear regression with a standard scaler). Predicted 20 years into the future and did another prediction of WHEN we would reach a negatavice growth rate. We are just 43 years from getting to a negative growth rate. But That is just pure speculation since it's quite far away into the future and we can't really know for sure...
Only time will tell. 

The results are presented in Tableau. 



Next steps: Find outliers that have a high birth rate. If there are no countries with High birth rates and high aveerage Education... We need to look at individual families and start digging there.
