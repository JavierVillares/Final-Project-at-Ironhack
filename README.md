# Final-Project-at-Ironhack
This is to see if the branch origing experiment works
git checkout -b name_of_branch **there is no need for  " " simbols it will look like this : git checkout -b experiment**
git branch **checks out the name of the selected brnach and the available branches**


**Name of the project:** The first steps towards the erradication of our cumulative COâ‚‚ 

This is project will use machine learning for predicting the progress of our world population and if possible our energy needs popu lation increases.

If time is available in the presentation I'd like to show how we will probably reach a peak population of 10-11 billion people (with machine learning) (using features that influence the birthrate)


Following that we will focus on cleaning our earth for future generations. 

Using Machine learning we should check if the data indicates a reduction in none renewable energy production and replacement with renewable energy. And if and when the world progresses towards a greener energy production. 

Time line. 
Week one 
Monday - Wednesday: Cleaning all the data and preparing it for machine learning 
Thursday to friday: Applying Machine learning and getting a possible overview of the results. 
Week two:
Streamlit or tableau for presentation of results and creation of story.
